Description
People are different. Some secretly read magazines full of interesting girls' 
pictures, others create an A-bomb in their cellar, others like using 
Windows, and some like difficult mathematical games. Latest marketing 
research shows, that this market segment was so far underestimated and 
that there is lack of such games. This kind of game was thus included into 
the KOKOD¨¢KH. The rules follow:  
 
Each player chooses two numbers Ai and Bi and writes them on a slip of 
paper. Others cannot see the numbers. In a given moment all players show 
their numbers to the others. The goal is to determine the sum of all 
expressions AiBi from all players including oneself and determine the 
remainder after division by a given number M. The winner is the one who 
first determines the correct result. According to the players' experience it is 
possible to increase the difficulty by choosing higher numbers.  
 
You should write a program that calculates the result and is able to find out 
who won the game. 

Input
The input consists of Z assignments. The number of them is given by the 
single positive integer Z appearing on the first line of input. Then the 
assignements follow. Each assignement begins with line containing an 
integer M (1 <= M <= 45000). The sum will be divided by this number. 
Next line contains number of players H (1 <= H <= 45000). Next exactly H 
lines follow. On each line, there are exactly two numbers Ai and Bi 
separated by space. Both numbers cannot be equal zero at the same time.

Output
For each assingnement there is the only one line of output. On this line, 
there is a number, the result of expression 
(A1B1+A2B2+ ... +AHBH)mod M.
