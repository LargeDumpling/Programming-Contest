Go to school1000ms/64mbTongjiang wanna go back to UESTC from Xipu. He had arrived Xipu bus station at T=0.He would like take a bus or walk, for details, it takes A minutes to take a bus while B minutes to walk(A<B will be hold).There are N bus lines all can take Tongjiang to UESTC, But as it was getting late,some bus lines may had already stopped running. Properly speaking, the bus line <i> have a probability of 1-Li/M that it had already stopped running and no more bus will come to Xipu station, and a probability of Li/M that there will be a bus come to Xipu station to take Tongjiang to UESTC. And in the second case the bus may arrive at bus station at any time T, which holds 0<=T<=Li, with equal probability. Tongjiang is a smart boy, he had Q different strategy to wait bus. Under strategy <i> He would set a latest time point Ti first. Then he started waiting for bus and take the first bus come to station who can take him to school or when time come to T=Ti and still no bus come, he would start walk to school.Now, Tongjiang wonders under each strategy, what's the expect time he arrive at school.For all bus line <i>	1/3*M<=Li<=2/3*MFor all strategy <i>	Min(L1,L2...LN)<=Ti<=Max(L1,L2...LN)6<=M<=1000001<=A,B<=1000002<=N<=121<=Q<=100000[input]First line five positive integer N,Q,M,A and B.Second line N positive integer L1,L2...LN.Then Q lines following,each line contains one integer means a latest time point Ti.[output]For each strategy,print one line with a decimal number and retains two decimal places.[Sample input]2 2 6 1 22 423[Smaple output]2.852.13
